* “[Managing the Tragedy of the Commons: A Partial Output-Sharing Approach](https://ejung11.github.io/files/paperdraft_partial_output_sharing_v9.pdf)”
  <details><summary> Abstract </summary><br> Common-pool resources (CPRs) suffer from a social dilemma known as the `Tragedy of the Commons', in which a selfish individual's rational decision leads to over-extraction of the resources and, consequently, leads to depletion of the resources. We can overcome the commons problem by changing the incentive mechanism. Introducing sharing arrangements among resource users induces free-riding behavior, which can offset over-extraction and potentially achieve a socially optimal outcome. One potential method of achieving this is partial output-sharing. Under this process, resource users are pooled into a single group and required to share a proportion of their output evenly with group members. I conduct a laboratory experiment to assess the effectiveness of the partial output-sharing model in CPR environments. The results indicate that partial output-sharing successfully reduces over-extraction and leads to higher collective earnings, suggesting that it can be an effective tool for managing CPRs sustainably.</details>

* "[Let’s Chat: Leveraging Chatbot Outreach for Improved Course Performance](https://ejung11.github.io/files/letschat.pdf)" (with Katharine Meyer, Lindsay C. Page, Catherine Mata, Eric N. Smith, B. Tyler Walsh, C. Lindsey Fifield, Michelle Tyson, Amy Eremionkhale, Michael Evans, Shelby Frost)
  <details><summary> Abstract </summary><br> This study reports on the causal effects of using a non-generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to provide course-specific, proactive outreach and support to students in large-enrollment undergraduate courses. Across both an American Government and Microeconomics course, students randomly assigned to receive chatbot messaging were four percentage points more likely to earn an A or B in the courses. Students assigned to treatment were more likely to complete homework and use supplemental instruction opportunities, which provide evidence that increased course engagement may be driving grade outcomes. We also find suggestive evidence the chatbot reduced the likelihood of students dropping or withdrawing from each course. Treatment effects were generally consistent across student demographics, with the exception of women in Microeconomics, who earned final grades that were seven points higher than women in the control group. The chatbot was well-received by students: 82 percent of students who completed an end-of-course survey recommended its continued use and expansion to other courses. This study provides promising evidence that integrating virtual outreach and communication to students in their college courses can enhance student engagement and learning. It also illustrates the capacity of AI for providing timely responses to students’ questions, reducing instructors’ time answering common questions and allowing them to devote more time to the students who need it most.</details>


* “[Impact of Comprehensive Smoke-Free Policies and Outdoor Smoking Bans on Smoking in South Korea: Using Synthetic Control Method](https://ejung11.github.io/files/paperdraft_sfp_southkorea_v9.pdf)”
  <details><summary> Abstract </summary><br> In 2011, South Korea implemented comprehensive smoke-free policy (SFP) and outdoor smoking ban, enforcing a complete smoking ban in various public places, including public transport, government buildings, medical facilities, nurseries, schools, large restaurants, bars, and theaters. Smoking was permitted only in specially designated smoking rooms, and violators were subject to fines. This was a significant shift from the policy established in 1995, which required designated establishments to offer separate smoking and non-smoking sections. To causally estimate the effect of the policy, we used a synthetic control group approach, comparing South Korea to a synthetic South Korea that did not implement the comprehensive SFP and outdoor smoking bans using data from 28 other high-income countries from 1995 to 2015. The results indicated that the comprehensive SFP and outdoor smoking bans effectively reduced smoking prevalence by an average of 2.3 percentage points from the 2011 smoking rate of 27.1%, representing an 8.5% reduction (p < 0.036). In practical terms, the comprehensive SFP and outdoor smoking bans deterred approximately 1.2 million people from smoking, either by encouraging current smokers to quit or preventing new smokers from starting.</details>

* “[The Impact of Legalized Recreational Marijuana Laws on Obesity](https://ejung11.github.io/files/paperdraft_rml_bodyweight_v2.pdf)” (with Jang Hyeok An and Reginal Hebert)
  <details><summary> Abstract </summary><br> This study investigates the causal effect of recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) on body mass index (BMI) using data from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). While numerous studies have explored the association between marijuana use and appetite, few have examined the causal evidence between marijuana use and BMI. Leveraging the staggered adoption of RMLs as a natural experiment, we employ a Two-Stage Difference-in-Difference (2SDiD) model to estimate the effect of RMLs on BMI. Although our initial 2SDiD point estimates indicate a significant decrease in BMI of approximately 0.294 units or 1.08 percent (0.294/27.33), the eventstudy analysis reveals a downward pre-trend in BMI prior to the implementation of RMLs. After accounting for this pre-trend, our findings suggest that RMLs have no statistically significant effect on BMI. Moreover, we find little evidence for potential mechanisms, or for heterogeneous effects depending on gender and age groups.</details>
